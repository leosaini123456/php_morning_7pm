"In" Operator allow us to use multiple where clause.

ex: age = 21 OR age = 45 OR age=20

"In" operator is shorthand for multiple "OR" operators

ex: 
Using Or Operator
select * from latx.studentdata where mark=78 OR mark=60 OR mark=55;

using In Operator
select * from latx.studentdata where mark IN (78,60,55);
